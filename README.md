Purpose: Create a day planner like webpage with localstorage save capabilities, time reactive coloring, and date noting.
    - Construct initial design with extensibility and variability in mind


Designer notes:
    - Function to read from local storage
    - function to load the page based on content
        - decided to run the color change based on page reloads, not an active time tracker.
    - function that runs when a save button is pushed
    - means of displaying day on the page.
